Driver

In Selenium, a driver is a component that acts as a bridge between your Selenium script and the actual web browser you want to automate.

What Does a Driver Do?
It translates your Selenium commands (written in Python, Java, etc.) into browser-specific actions.
It launches the browser, controls it (click, input text, navigate, etc.), and retrieves data from it.
